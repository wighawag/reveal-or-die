/**
 * SWAPPING THE RENDERER MUST COST ONE FILE.
 *
 * `$lib/placement/render/index.ts` names which canvas host this game mounts,
 * and D11 makes that choice a BRANCH axis: `main` carries the immediate
 * canvas-2d host and no rendering library, and `with/pixi-js` carries pixi. The
 * branch is only affordable if it edits that one shared file, because every
 * other shared file it touches is a conflict site that `main` keeps developing
 * (rule N1 in the plan, `work:work/specs/proposed/games-on-this-foundation.md`).
 *
 * The file most at risk is `routes/play/+page.svelte`. It mounts whichever host
 * `index.ts` names and passes it a fixed set of props, two of which - `cellSize`
 * and `gridCells` - only a scene-graph host has any use for. The canvas-2d host
 * therefore ACCEPTS AND IGNORES them, and says so in a comment on each.
 *
 * That looks like dead code and it is not: it is what keeps the page identical
 * on both nodes. Delete the unused props as a tidy-up and the page has to
 * change on the branch too, which doubles the branch's shared-file budget and
 * puts a permanent conflict into a route both nodes keep editing. The tidy-up
 * is also the kind of change that passes every other test in the tree, which is
 * why the rule is written as a test rather than as a comment.
 *
 * This is a SOURCE check rather than a runtime one on purpose. Svelte 5 does
 * not throw on an undeclared prop, so the failure it guards against is silent
 * at runtime: the host simply ignores something the page meant it to have.
