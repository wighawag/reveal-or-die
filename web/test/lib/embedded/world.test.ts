// describing the world it was given from one describing the app's build-time
// chain, because they are the same. Here they are not: the chain id, the
// contract addresses and the records all differ from the generated
// `$lib/deployments`, so every assertion below fails if the context quietly
// falls back.

// AND WHAT IT DEPLOYS IS THIS GAME'S OWN OFFLINE DEPLOYMENT, not a copy of it.
