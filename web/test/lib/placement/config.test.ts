/**
 * THE CHUNK SIZE COMES OFF THE DEPLOYMENT, and this is what says so.
 *
 * A turn longer than one transaction is committed as a hash chain, and the head
 * of that chain depends on how the turn was cut up. So a client that carried its
 * own number - a constant, a default, a fallback - would commit a head the
 * contract cannot follow the moment the deployment said anything else, and the
 * only symptom would be a reveal reverting after the bond was already immovable.
 *
 * The other half of this pair is in `contracts/test/js/Game.test.ts`, which
 * deploys a game at a different chunk size and watches the contract's rule
 * follow; together they are what stops the two sides drifting.
