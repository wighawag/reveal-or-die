/**
 * The board's immediate renderer, against a context that RECORDS rather than
 * paints.
 *
 * There is a browser test beside this one (`test/lib/game/render/
 * canvas2d.svelte.test.ts`) that reads real pixels back off a real canvas, and
 * it is the better test of everything this draws. This file exists for the one
 * thing pixels cannot see.
 *
 * CULLING IS INVISIBLE TO A PIXEL TEST. It is the only logic in this module
 * that is not a drawing call, and it changes no picture at all: canvas silently
 * discards a `fillRect` at a wildly out-of-range coordinate, so a board that
 * culls and a board that does not are byte-identical on screen. Removing the
 * culling was checked against the pixel suite and passed all six of its tests.
 *
 * What culling actually is, is WORK - and the amount of it is unbounded, since
 * the state store is scoped to the camera's ZONES and a zone is 16 cells wide,
 * so it legitimately hands over cells that are off screen. Work is countable,
 * which is why this counts calls.

 * TypeError in the test rather than being silently absorbed - which is the
