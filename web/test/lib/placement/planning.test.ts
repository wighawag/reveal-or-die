/**
 * A TURN THIS CLIENT CANNOT OPEN IS A FORFEITED STAKE, and planning is the only
 * place that can stop one being asked for.
 *
 * A submission longer than one chunk is revealed in several transactions, in
 * order, inside a window that shuts. Chunks that do not land are a missed
 * reveal, which forfeits whatever the game puts at stake - the bond here, the
 * avatar on the identity branches, where it was measured costing four of them
 * in a single harness run. Nothing on chain can refuse the commitment, because
 * at commit time the contract holds a hash and nothing else.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT is a turn cap. A cap is a rule about what a player may do,
 * it only binds where identity is scarce, and the framework takes no position
 * on it. This is a statement about the window.
