 * downstream (the HUD's message, the offer of a top-up, the automatic resume

 * Classification itself belongs to `isInsufficientFundsFailure` upstream and is
 * tested there against many node shapes. What is tested here is that this game
 * asks it, believes it, and wraps only what it says - in particular that a
 * CONTRACT REVERT does not become an out-of-gas offer, because that is the
 * failure mode a naive message match reintroduces and it is invisible from the

	 * number the player can be told in advance, and it removes an
	 * `eth_estimateGas` round trip from every chunk of a reveal. The danger is
	 * the other direction: a limit below what the transaction needs is an
	 * out-of-gas reveal, which is a MISSED reveal and forfeits the stake. That
	 * is guarded in the contracts suite (`GasBudget.test.ts` fails when the
	 * worst case comes within 10% of the declared figure); what is guarded here
	 * is that the declared figure is the one actually used, rather than a
	 * constant or nothing at all.
