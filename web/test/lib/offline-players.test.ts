/**
 * THE OTHER PLAYERS, DRIVEN AGAINST A REAL CHAIN.
 *
 * No `.svelte.` infix, so this runs in the `server` project: node, no DOM. That
 * is the right harness and not a compromise - webevm runs under node, so a
 * whole world (a chain, this game's real deploy, three enrolled members and
 * four transactions a round) is testable without a browser, and what a browser
 * adds on top is covered by the offline e2e.
 *
 * WHY IT DRIVES `tick()` RATHER THAN `start()`. The loop is a `setInterval`,
 * and a test that waited for one would be asserting on a timer. Every pass this
 * file makes is one the timer would have made, in the same order, which is the
 * whole reason `tick` is exported.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SPELLS AN IDENTITY OR A STAKE, and that is deliberate rather
 * than fastidious. Both differ between branches of this template - upstream a
 * player is an address with a bonded reserve, on the identity branch a token
 * with custody at stake - so a test that named either would be the sixteenth
 * file on that branch's divergence budget. It asks the world instead
 * (`stakeForOfflinePlayer`, `offlineIdentityOf`, `playedByTheWorld`), which is
 * exactly the seam `$lib/offline` exists to be, and the one place a branch
 * difference does surface is marked at the line.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR, in one sentence: an offline world that enrols one member
 * hides nothing, because unanimity is satisfied by the only person present and
 * two of `advanceCycle`'s three conditions cannot be reached at all. Every
 * assertion below is about the third member existing and ACTING.
