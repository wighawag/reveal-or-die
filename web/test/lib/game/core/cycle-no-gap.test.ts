/**
 * A CYCLE IS A COMMIT PHASE FOLLOWED BY A REVEAL PHASE AND NOTHING ELSE.
 *
 * This is the arithmetic the round's recovery rests on, and it is load-bearing
 * in a way that is easy to lose by accident. Because there is no trailing
 * segment, a commitment made in the CURRENT cycle is always still openable: you
 * are either in the phase that takes it or in the phase that opens it. That is
 * why reconciling a round with the chain needs nothing at all for the too-late
 * case - the moment the reveal window shuts, the cycle has advanced, and the
 * existing missed-reveal path reports it and offers the settlement.
 *
 * A settlement window, a gap between cycles, or a cycle that can turn over
 * while a reveal window is still nominally open would each void that argument,
 * silently, and the symptom would be a player losing a stake rather than
 * anything failing. Nothing tested it until this file: the property was true by
 * construction, and "true by construction" is exactly what a later parameter
 * quietly stops being.
 *
 * WHAT EACH POLICY DOES WITH IT:
 *
 * - `timed` preserves it by the original arithmetic, swept below.
 * - `hybrid` preserves it because an early advance only ever WIDENS a window:
 *   opening the reveal phase early leaves the deadline where it was, and
 *   closing the cycle early is refused until every commitment in it has been
 *   revealed, so no open commitment is ever left behind. Swept below over the
 *   grid, and the contract's half is pinned in `contracts/test/js`.
 * - `manual` preserves it by construction of the advance: the only transitions
 *   are commit to reveal within one cycle, and reveal to the next cycle once
 *   everything committed has been opened. There is no clock to sweep, so that
 *   half lives entirely in the contract suite.
