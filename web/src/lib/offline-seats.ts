/**
 * HOW MANY SEATS ARE AT THE TABLE, AND WHO IS IN EACH ONE.
 *
 * A SEAT, NOT A PLAYER COUNT, and that is the whole of the design rather than
 * a flourish. A count answers "how many", which is the question a lobby asks
 * today; a seat answers "who is there", which is the question every later
 * question turns out to be. A seat has an OCCUPANT, and today an occupant is
 * either YOU or THE WORLD. That is all it is now, and it is what makes hotseat
 * additive rather than a redesign: a second human is a third kind of occupant,
 * and nothing else here has to move - `tableOf` still lays the seats out, the
 * provisioning still walks the table asking each occupant for an address, and
 * the lobby still chooses how many there are.
 *
 * WHAT A SEAT IS NOT is a setting on a live world. What ENROLS a player is
 * holding this game's stake, which happens once, during provisioning: the
 * contract starts waiting for anyone with a funded reserve (on the identity
 * branches, for anyone whose avatar it has custody of). So the number of seats
 * is baked into a world at the moment it boots, and changing it means a NEW
 * world rather than a setting - see `$lib/offline-lobby`, which is where that
 * is enforced, and `$lib/embedded/chain-id`, which is what makes a new world
 * cheap.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE KNOWS WHAT A SEAT HOLDS. A lobby chooses how many people are at
 * the table; what each of them is given, and how this game spells who they
 * are, is `$lib/offline`'s, which is the one file per branch of this template
 * that is allowed to know. That is why this file is byte-identical on every
 * branch and why it should stay that way.

/**
 * The keys the world plays with, and they are PUBLIC AND FIXED on purpose -
 * the same argument `$lib/offline` already makes for the deployer and the
 * admin.
 *
 * These are hardhat's well-known development accounts, derived from the
 * mnemonic every tool in this ecosystem ships with. There is nothing to
 * protect: the chain exists only in this tab, it has no bridge to anywhere,
 * and its ether is a number a cheat call sets. Generating a key per world
 * would buy no security and would cost the one thing that matters - a world's
 * players would be different addresses between runs, so nothing about a world
 * could be written down or reasoned about.
 *
 * ONE PUBLIC FACT RATHER THAN THIRTY-SIX. Writing the keys out would be
 * eighteen pairs of opaque hex, which is eighteen chances for a cascade to
 * halve the list or transpose a digit; the mnemonic and an index are the same
 * information with one thing to get wrong.
 *
 * AND THE ADDRESSES ARE A WIRE, in exactly `AGENTS.md`'s sense. A world that
 * has booted has these addresses ENROLLED on chain, holding this game's stake;
 * a build that derived different ones would restore that world and find its
 * members unreachable - the cycle would wait forever for players nobody holds
 * a key for, and under the manual policy waiting forever is what it does. So
 * this derivation is not an implementation detail to tidy: `test/lib/offline-seats.test.ts`
 * pins the first addresses against the ones the world has been playing as.

/**
 * THE CEILING, and it is deliberately NOT "however many keys the list holds".
 *
 * The supply is eighteen (hardhat's accounts #2 to #19), so the key list is
 * not the bound and must not be allowed to become the reason. What bounds a
 * table is what a ROUND COSTS, and that turned out not to be the arithmetic
 * anybody would have predicted.
 *
 * THE ARITHMETIC SAYS IT SHOULD BE FREE. The world acts for its players one at
 * a time (`offline-players.ts` says why: they share one chain in one worker,
 * and a burst of commits is a burst of blocks nobody is waiting for), so a
 * table of N costs 2(N-1) transactions in series per round plus two advances -
 * and a transaction on a chain in a tab is 15 to 20 ms. Eighteen of them is a
 * third of a second.
 *
 * AND IT IS NOW FREE, WHICH IT WAS NOT WHEN THIS NUMBER WAS FIVE. This used to
 * be a staircase in whole poll intervals: four and five seats paid 1.33 s for
 * their first round and six and eight paid 3.8-4.4 s for every round, because
 * the `advanceCycle` that opens the reveal phase SUCCEEDED on chain, emitted
 * `CycleAdvanced`, and left `getCycle` reporting the commit phase. The cause
 * was not the seats and not the transactions: `webevm` ran everything that
 * executes - transactions AND `eth_call` - on one state manager with one
 * checkpoint stack, and nothing serialised them, so whichever of two
 * overlapping executions reverted its checkpoint last discarded what the other
 * had committed. What a table of N really bought was more traffic in flight
 * while the world's writes executed, and the staircase was the probability of
 * that overlap crossing one.
 *
 * `webevm` 0.6.0 serialises the node's whole public surface (its ADR 0012),
 * and that is what this number now rests on. Re-measured the same way,
 * headless chromium, production build, load ~1.1, five runs of six rounds
 * each, counting every steady round rather than quoting a range:
 *
 * | seats | boot | a steady round | rounds over 500 ms |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | 3 | 348-350 ms | median 228 ms | 0/25 |
 * | 5 | 318-364 ms | median 221 ms | 0/25 |
 * | 8 | 339-352 ms | median 223 ms | 0/25 |
 * | 10 | 350-377 ms | median 232 ms | **0/56** |
 * | 11 | 353-836 ms | median 231 ms | 4/56 |
 * | 12 | 824-841 ms | median 235 ms | 2/25 |
 * | 16 | 833-845 ms | median 330 ms | 5/25 |
 * | 19 | 823-846 ms | median 334 ms | 10/25 |
 *
 * The staircase is gone and so is the anomalous first round: the median is
 * flat at about 230 ms from three seats to twelve, which is the arithmetic
 * this file predicted all along.
 *
 * SO TEN, AND IT IS STILL A MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN A PRINCIPLE. Ten is the
 * largest table at which every round measured was steady - 56 of 56, against
 * 4 of 56 already slow at eleven - and what goes wrong above it is the old
 * shape without the old cause: a pass over that many members occasionally
 * outlasts the poke that would have ended the round, so the round waits out a
 * one-second backstop instead. That is a latency budget, not a lost write, and
 * whoever wants a bigger table should spend it on the poke rather than on this
 * constant.
 *
 * IT IS STILL DELIBERATELY NOT THE KEY SUPPLY. That is eighteen (hardhat's
 * accounts #2 to #19), so a table of nineteen is derivable and measurably
 * worse: ten of twenty-five rounds over half a second. The key list was never
 * the bound and must not become the reason.
