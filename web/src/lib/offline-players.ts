/**
 * THE OTHER PLAYERS IN THE OFFLINE WORLD, because a commit-reveal game with one
 * player is not one.
 *
 * WHY THERE HAS TO BE MORE THAN ONE AT ALL. A cycle with a single waited-for
 * member hides nothing: unanimity is satisfied by the only person present, and
 * two of the three conditions `advanceCycle` exists to enforce
 * (`StillWaitingToCommit`, `StillWaitingToReveal`) can never be reached. THREE
 * rather than two, because two is a duel: "everyone" and "the other one" are
 * the same statement, and a board where two players contest one cell is a
 * special case of the rule rather than an instance of it. At three, the
 * accumulation in `_place` has something to accumulate and the
 * order-independence property has something to say.
 *
 * WHY THE WORLD PLAYS THEM. Under the manual cycle policy nothing moves until
 * every waited-for member has acted, so two members who never act do not make
 * a quiet game - they make a FROZEN one, for the human as well. Either the
 * world plays them or it must not enrol them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not the framework's, it is not a mode, and it is not
 * the NPCs a later phase wants: there is no intelligence here, no difficulty
 * and no interface for either. It is the smallest thing that makes the cycle
 * have somebody to wait for, written in the app beside the world that wants it,
 * exactly as the provisioning hook is.
 *
 * THEY HOLD NOTHING IN MEMORY, AND THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING PROPERTY. Both the
 * secret and the actions are DERIVED from (chain, game, identity, cycle), so a
 * reload reconstructs them exactly. The alternative bricks the world: a player
 * that commits and then forgets its secret can never reveal, `advanceCycle`
 * refuses to close a cycle with an unopened commitment in it (correctly - that
 * is what stops a turn being stranded), and the human's game stops for good
 * with their stake inside it. This is D9's argument about a player's own
 * secret, arriving one level down and for the same reason.
 *
 * AND BECAUSE IT IS DERIVED, THE DERIVATION IS A WIRE. A build that changes
 * {@link turnFor} or {@link secretFor} can no longer open a commitment an
 * earlier build left on chain, which under the manual policy is not a lost turn
 * but a frozen world: no advance can close a cycle holding an unopened
 * commitment, and `acknowledgeMissedReveal` refuses a commitment from the
 * CURRENT cycle. {@link createOfflinePlayers} closes that hole from the only
 * side it can be closed from - it re-commits, in the commit phase, whenever the
 * head on chain is not one this build can open - so by the time a reveal phase
 * opens every played commitment is openable. The same care AGENTS.md asks for
 * around a persisted storage key applies here, one level over.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE KNOWS HOW THIS GAME SPELLS AN IDENTITY, which is what keeps the
 * template's branches from diverging over it. A player arrives as a key and an
 * identity already spelled the way the CONTRACT spells it, so the one thing
 * that differs between branches (an address widened, against a token id) stays
 * in `$lib/offline`, which differs there already.
