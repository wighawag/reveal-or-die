/**
 * Gamepad to intents.
 *
 * Same two halves as `keys.ts` and as `$lib/game/render/gestures.ts`:
 * {@link createGamepadRecognizer} is a state machine over plain numbers, and
 * {@link attachGamepad} is the polling loop that feeds it. A gamepad has no
 * events for its buttons - the browser only offers a snapshot per frame - so
 * the edge detection ("this button is newly down") is the recogniser's whole
 * job, and it is exactly the part that is impossible to test through a DOM.
 *
 * THE DEFECTS THIS DOES NOT REPRODUCE, named in `docs/audits/03-renderer.md`
 * 3.4:
 *
 * - the deleted `render/gamepads.ts` read `gamepad.buttons[3].pressed`
 *   unguarded and assumed `buttons[12..15]` exist. A controller reporting
 *   fewer buttons threw inside a `requestAnimationFrame` callback, every
 *   frame. Every read here goes through {@link pressed}, which answers false
 *   for a button that is not there.
 * - its `start()` re-added the window listeners on each call and stopped its
 *   loop only through a `running` flag, so a second `start()` before the first
 *   loop noticed ran two loops. There is no `start()` here: attaching returns
 *   its own teardown and owns its own frame handle, so two attachments are two
 *   independent bindings and one teardown cannot half-stop the other.
 *
 * The loop also does not run at all until a pad announces itself. A player
 * with no gamepad - most of them - should not be paying for a
 * `requestAnimationFrame` every frame for a device that is not there, and
 * `getGamepads` reports nothing until the browser has seen a button press
 * anyway, which is the same moment `gamepadconnected` fires.
