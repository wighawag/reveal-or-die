/**
 * Gas to allow for ONE TRANSACTION of each kind: a commit, and one reveal step.
 *
 * READ OFF THE DEPLOYMENT, NOT DECLARED HERE, and that is the important part.
 * These used to be two constants in this file, and this file is INHERITED down
 * the template tree while contracts are NOT: every game writes its own. So a
 * descendant ran its own contracts while budgeting with gas measured against
 * somebody else's, in a file whose text did not differ at all - which is the
 * failure this tree keeps paying for, a value merging cleanly while its
 * reasoning does not. `with/nft-identity` is the worked example: the same two
 * transactions measure 99,102 and 374,085 there against `main`'s 116,898 and
 * 535,561, because a placement costs nothing so a reveal writes no stake.
 *
 * Now the deploy declares them (`contracts/rocketh/config.ts`, recorded into
 * `linkedData` by `deploy/010_deploy_game.ts`) and this reads them, exactly as
 * it already does for `actionsPerReveal` and `placementCost`. A game that
 * writes its own contracts cannot inherit a wrong figure, because there is
 * nothing here to inherit. `contracts/test/js/GasBudget.test.ts` is what stops
 * the declared figures rotting as the contracts change.
 *
 * WHAT THE CHUNK BOUNDS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT, because the next reader of these
 * numbers will be the credits work and this is the distinction it turns on. The
 * reveal figure is a true maximum of ONE TRANSACTION and stays one in every game
 * on every chain, however long a turn is - that is the whole property the chunk
 * buys, and it is what makes a gas LIMIT possible at all. What the chunk does
 * not bound is the number of reveal STEPS, and in a game whose turns are
 * unbounded (any game where an action costs nothing, which includes
 * `with/nft-identity` here, and stratagems) there is no worst case for a TURN to
 * be found.
 *
 * So anything that wants to answer the player's actual question - how many TURNS
 * can I still play - cannot be sized from a maximum, and must be sized from an
 * EXPECTATION: how many actions a player is expected to submit per turn, which
 * is the game's to state and should be a named parameter rather than an implicit
 * one. That is why the stipend below is counted in STEPS: it is honest, and it
 * does not answer that question.
 *
 * The tempting alternative is to price a credit PER ACTION, which is exact and
 * gives up the thing credits exist for - "one credit is one user action" stops
 * being true, and a number that varies with what you happen to be doing is a
 * number nobody can plan against. An average with its expectation written down
 * is worth more than an exact figure with no unit.
 *
 * THAT LAST PARAGRAPH IS WHY THIS BRANCH IS THE INTERESTING CASE AND NOT A
 * FOOTNOTE. `main`'s turns are bounded economically at ten placements, so an
 * expectation there is a refinement of a maximum that exists. Here a placement
 * costs nothing, so there IS no maximum, and an expectation is the only thing a
 * stipend can be built from at all.
 *
 * THIS FILE USED TO CARRY `main`'S FIGURES AND SAY SO, with a paragraph
 * explaining that keeping them was the safe direction for a reservation. That
 * paragraph is gone because the problem it was managing is gone: the numbers are
 * declared by the deploy now, so this branch reads its own (125,000 and 425,000
 * against measurements of 99,102 and 374,049) and nothing has to be knowingly
 * wrong here to keep a shared file shared. **And it stopped being a matter of
 * taste the moment they became LIMITS**: an inherited figure that is merely
 * generous as a reservation is a ceiling measured against the wrong contracts,
 * and on this branch `main`'s reveal figure is 60% above what a reveal here
 * costs, which is not safety, it is a number nobody has checked.
 *
 * THEY ARE PASSED AS GAS LIMITS, and that is what the rest of this comment is
 * insurance for. A limit below what the transaction needs is not a slow turn, it
 * is an out-of-gas reveal, which is a MISSED reveal - and on this branch that
 * does not cost a bond, it costs the avatar, because custody is the stake and a
 * forfeit is all-or-nothing however far the chain got (ADR-0002). Three things
 * stand behind it, and none of them is optimism.
 *
 * The figure is measured against THESE contracts, because the deployment
 * declares it rather than this inherited file carrying one game's number into
 * another game's build (ADR-0003). `contracts/test/js/GasBudget.test.ts` fails
 * if the worst case a chunk can reach ever comes within 10% of it, so the
 * headroom is a tested property rather than an accident of when it was last
 * looked at - here 26% on a commit and 14% on a reveal. And gas USAGE is a
 * property of the contract code and the pinned EVM revision rather than of the
 * chain, so the figure travels: what genuinely varies per deployment is the gas
 * PRICE, which is `expectedWorstGasPrice` in the chain properties and is
 * declared per chain already.
 *
 * What it buys is the reason to take the risk at all: the cost of a move becomes
 * a ceiling stated in advance instead of an estimate, which is the only way gas
 * can honestly be denominated in moves - and it removes an `eth_estimateGas`
 * round trip from every chunk, inside a window a multi-chunk turn is already
 * spending several transactions of.
 */

/**
 * How many TURNS of gas a new player is given.
 *
 * IT COUNTS TURNS AGAIN, AND ONLY BECAUSE THE DEPLOYMENT NOW SAYS WHAT A TURN
 * IS. When the reveal became chunked this had to become a count of STEPS - one
 * commit or one reveal transaction - because a turn had stopped having a fixed
 * cost: it arrives in `ceil(actions / actionsPerReveal)` transactions and,
 * wherever an action is free, nothing bounds how many. Counting steps was
 * honest and it did not answer the player's question, which is how many more
 * TURNS they can play.
 *
 * `expectedActionsPerTurn` is that missing number, declared by the deploy
 * because it is a statement about the GAME rather than about the framework. It
 * is an expectation and not a maximum - there is no maximum to be had - so a
 * player who plans much longer turns than the game expects will get fewer than
 * this many. That is the honest trade, and it is acceptable HERE precisely
 * because this is a starting float rather than a promise: when it runs out the
 * top-up flow is the remedy, and `resumeWhenGasArrives` picks the submission
 * back up by itself.
 *
 * IT IS NOT HOW CREDITS ARE PRICED, and the difference is the point. The credit
 * count is shown to the player as what they can still do, so it must be a FLOOR
 * (`core/connection/credits.ts` says so, and prices it at the worst expected gas
 * price for the same reason). An expectation is not a floor. So credits stay
 * denominated in what a TRANSACTION costs, which is a real bound, and only this
 * float is sized from what a turn is expected to cost.
