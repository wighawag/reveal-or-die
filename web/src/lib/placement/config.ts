/**
 * Gas to allow for ONE TRANSACTION of each kind: a commit, and one reveal step.
 *
 * READ OFF THE DEPLOYMENT, NOT DECLARED HERE, and that is the important part.
 * These used to be two constants in this file, and this file is INHERITED down
 * the template tree while contracts are NOT: every game writes its own. So a
 * descendant ran its own contracts while budgeting with gas measured against
 * somebody else's, in a file whose text did not differ at all - which is the
 * failure this tree keeps paying for, a value merging cleanly while its
 * reasoning does not. `with/nft-identity` is the worked example: the same two
 * transactions measure 99,102 and 374,085 there against `main`'s 116,898 and
 * 535,561, because a placement costs nothing so a reveal writes no stake.
 *
 * Now the deploy declares them (`contracts/rocketh/config.ts`, recorded into
 * `linkedData` by `deploy/010_deploy_game.ts`) and this reads them, exactly as
 * it already does for `actionsPerReveal` and `placementCost`. A game that
 * writes its own contracts cannot inherit a wrong figure, because there is
 * nothing here to inherit. `contracts/test/js/GasBudget.test.ts` is what stops
 * the declared figures rotting as the contracts change.
 *
 * WHAT THE CHUNK BOUNDS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT, because the next reader of these
 * numbers will be the credits work and this is the distinction it turns on. The
 * reveal figure is a true maximum of ONE TRANSACTION and stays one in every game
 * on every chain, however long a turn is - that is the whole property the chunk
 * buys, and it is what makes a gas LIMIT possible at all. What the chunk does
 * not bound is the number of reveal STEPS, and in a game whose turns are
 * unbounded (any game where an action costs nothing, which includes
 * `with/nft-identity` here, and stratagems) there is no worst case for a TURN to
 * be found.
 *
 * So anything that wants to answer the player's actual question - how many TURNS
 * can I still play - cannot be sized from a maximum, and must be sized from an
 * EXPECTATION: how many actions a player is expected to submit per turn, which
 * is the game's to state and should be a named parameter rather than an implicit
 * one. That is why the stipend below is counted in STEPS: it is honest, and it
 * does not answer that question.
 *
 * The tempting alternative is to price a credit PER ACTION, which is exact and
 * gives up the thing credits exist for - "one credit is one user action" stops
 * being true, and a number that varies with what you happen to be doing is a
 * number nobody can plan against. An average with its expectation written down
 * is worth more than an exact figure with no unit.
 *
 * THEY ARE STILL NOT PASSED AS GAS LIMITS, which is a deliberate stop short of
 * what the credits design eventually wants. Passing a limit turns a number that
 * is too low into an out-of-gas mid-submission, and that is not a slow turn, it
 * is a missed reveal, which loses the bond AND blocks the next cycle until it is
 * acknowledged. Declaring them per deployment and pinning them with a test is
 * the half of that work which makes a limit possible; the other half is the
 * expectation above.
 */

/**
 * How many TURNS of gas a new player is given.
 *
 * IT COUNTS TURNS AGAIN, AND ONLY BECAUSE THE DEPLOYMENT NOW SAYS WHAT A TURN
 * IS. When the reveal became chunked this had to become a count of STEPS - one
 * commit or one reveal transaction - because a turn had stopped having a fixed
 * cost: it arrives in `ceil(actions / actionsPerReveal)` transactions and,
 * wherever an action is free, nothing bounds how many. Counting steps was
 * honest and it did not answer the player's question, which is how many more
 * TURNS they can play.
 *
 * `expectedActionsPerTurn` is that missing number, declared by the deploy
 * because it is a statement about the GAME rather than about the framework. It
 * is an expectation and not a maximum - there is no maximum to be had - so a
 * player who plans much longer turns than the game expects will get fewer than
 * this many. That is the honest trade, and it is acceptable HERE precisely
 * because this is a starting float rather than a promise: when it runs out the
 * top-up flow is the remedy, and `resumeWhenGasArrives` picks the submission
 * back up by itself.
 *
 * IT IS NOT HOW CREDITS ARE PRICED, and the difference is the point. The credit
 * count is shown to the player as what they can still do, so it must be a FLOOR
 * (`core/connection/credits.ts` says so, and prices it at the worst expected gas
 * price for the same reason). An expectation is not a floor. So credits stay
 * denominated in what a TRANSACTION costs, which is a real bound, and only this
 * float is sized from what a turn is expected to cost.
