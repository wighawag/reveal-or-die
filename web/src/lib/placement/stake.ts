/**
 * WHAT THIS GAME PUTS AT STAKE, in the words a player reads.
 *
 * `./reserve.ts` is what the stake IS; this is what it is CALLED. They are
 * separate files because the second one has consumers the first must not
 * acquire: the HUD model and the play route both describe the stake, and a
 * store that imported a formatter to satisfy them would be carrying UI copy
 * for the sake of two callers.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ONE MODULE RATHER THAN LITERALS AT THE SITES THAT NEED THEM.
 * `with/nft-identity` changes what is at stake - custody of a token instead of
 * a bonded reserve - and every sentence here is one it has to rewrite. Left in
 * place, those sentences would put `placement/ui/hud.ts` (523 lines, developed
 * every time the HUD gains a state) and `routes/play/+page.svelte` (a route,
 * and one that `with/pixi-js` depends on being byte-identical) on that
 * branch's shared-file list forever, to hold about six strings. Here they are
 * a file that exists in order to differ, which is the difference between a
 * conflict site and a switch. Rules N1 and N2 of Decision 3, in the plan on
 * the `work` branch.
 *
 * The test of whether something belongs here: would a game that gates
 * differently have to change the WORDS? If it would only change the number, it
 * is a formatter and belongs where it is.
