/**
 * The template game's half of pushing the cycle on.
 *
 * The framework owns WHEN an advance is worth sending and what the conditions
 * are (`$lib/game/core/advance`); what it cannot own is which contract to ask
 * and which contract to call, so this is the game's half: `getAttendance` read
 * into the framework's shape, and `advanceCycle` sent the way every other move
 * is sent.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A MOVE, which is the thing to keep in mind while reading it.
 * An advance is permissionless and strictly conditional: it may only ever do
 * what the rules already permit, so it takes nothing from anybody and belongs
 * to nobody. That is what makes it safe to send from the local signer without
 * asking the player - the framework may spend gas on their behalf to keep the
 * cycle turning, and may never spend the STAKE without being asked, which is
 * what `missed-reveal.ts` is careful about and this file has no equivalent of.

 * tab-local chain is frozen between transactions - and a manual cycle reads no
 * timestamp at all, so there is nothing for a stale one to get wrong. (See
