 * WHY PLANNING IS WHERE THIS IS ENFORCED, and why it is not a turn cap. A
 * submission longer than one chunk is revealed in several transactions, in
 * order, inside a window that shuts; chunks that do not land are a MISSED
 * REVEAL, which forfeits whatever the game puts at stake. Nothing on chain can
 * prevent committing to a turn that cannot be opened, because at commit time
 * the contract is holding a hash. So the only place it can be stopped is before
 * the player asks for it.
 *
 * It is a statement about THIS CLIENT and the chain it is on - how many
 * transactions fit in the time available - and not about what a player may do,
 * which is the game's own business and which the framework deliberately takes
 * no position on. A game that wants a real cap enforces one in its own reveal.
 *
 * `undefined` does not bound anything, deliberately. The limit is only
 * meaningful once the chain clock has measured how fast blocks arrive, and
 * refusing a player's clicks on the strength of a guessed block time would be
 * worse than the hazard: by the time a commitment can be made the clock has
 * synced, because the same store drives the phase countdown.
