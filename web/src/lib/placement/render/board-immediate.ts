/**
 * The board, drawn from scratch every frame.
 *
 * IMMEDIATE rendering, the twgl / stratagems shape. There is no scene graph and
 * nothing is remembered between frames: the renderer is handed the current view
 * state and draws it. Compare `board-renderer.ts`, which draws the same board
 * with the same rules as a pixi scene graph; between them they are what keeps
 * the render seam honest.
 *
 * The canvas-2d context is a stand-in for a real GPU renderer, chosen so the
 * template can ship a second renderer without a second dependency. Everything
 * structural here (the per-frame draw, the culling, drawing in game units under
 * the camera transform) is what a twgl renderer does; only the four drawing
 * calls would change.
