 * What a control DID, before anyone decides what it MEANS.

 * The same split `gestures.ts` makes for pointers: a recogniser turns raw
 * input into an intent, and the GAME turns the intent into a move. Neither
 * half knows the other's business, which is what lets one mapping serve a
 * keyboard, a gamepad and an on-screen d-pad without three copies of the
 * game's rules.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY SMALL, and named after the shape of the input rather than
 * after any game. A direction, a confirming action, a second action and a way
 * back is what a board game's controls are; "step north", "commit the round"
 * and "leave the world" are what a particular game calls them, and that
 * translation belongs in the game. Anything that has to say "avatar" or
 * "epoch" to be described is on the wrong side of this line.

 * Not a vector: whether north is `y - 1` or `y + 1`, and whether the board is

 * makes for emitting a fractional point rather than a cell.
