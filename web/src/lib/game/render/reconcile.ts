/**
 * What changed between two snapshots of a keyed collection.
 *
 * A stateful renderer (pixi, three.js) does not draw a picture, it maintains a
 * scene graph, so what it needs from a new view state is not the state but the
 * DIFFERENCE: which objects to create, which to update, which to destroy. Every
 * such renderer writes that loop, and writing it by hand goes wrong in the same
 * four ways every time, so it is written once here.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous: no scene graph, no framework, no side effects. That is
 * what lets the awkward cases (an entity that vanishes, a reload back to
 * Unloaded, an epoch boundary) be tested without a GPU, which is the only way
 * they ever get tested at all.

 *
 * This is what replaces the hand-written "dirty key" strings that stateful
