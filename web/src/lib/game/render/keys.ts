/**
 * Keyboard to intents.
 *
 * Split the way `gestures.ts` is split, for the same reason:
 *
 * - {@link recognizeKey} is a pure function over a plain sample. No DOM types,
 *   so every branch is testable in the node project, including the ones that
 *   are awkward to perform by hand (a held key repeating, a modifier chord).
 * - {@link attachKeys} is the DOM binding, and is deliberately thin.
 *
 * WHAT A HAND-WRITTEN ONE GETS WRONG, from the version this replaces in a
 * game built on this template: it bound to `document` unconditionally, with no
 * `preventDefault` and no check for where the keystroke was going, so arrows
 * and space acted on the board while the player was typing in a modal.
 *
 * WHERE A KEYSTROKE IS AIMED comes in two kinds here rather than one, because
 * "is it an interactive element" is too blunt in both directions. A text field
 * consumes EVERY key, so the game must hear none of them. A button consumes
 * only the keys that activate it, so a game that ignored the arrows as well
 * would go dead the moment the player pressed the on-screen d-pad with a mouse:
 * the button keeps focus, and the keyboard stops working with nothing on screen
 * to explain why.

 * fingers, and a player on one expects their own letters) and irrelevant for
