 * The template's SECOND renderer exists to keep the render seam honest. A seam
 * with one implementation is a guess, and this is the cheapest possible way to
 * have two: no dependency, no shader, and it still exercises everything a twgl
 * or three.js renderer would (a per-frame draw, the camera transform, the
 * device pixel ratio, the view-state snapshot).
 *
 * Unlike the pixi host, an immediate renderer draws in GAME UNITS: there is no
 * scene graph authored in pixels, so there is no reason to convert. One
 * consequence to keep in mind, because it produces hairlines that vanish at low
 * zoom and slabs at high zoom: after {@link applyCamera} the context's
 * `lineWidth` is in game units too, so a line meant to be one pixel wide is
 * `1 / transform.scale`.
