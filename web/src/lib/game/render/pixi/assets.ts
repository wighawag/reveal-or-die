/**
 * The sprite bundle: loading it, and reporting how far it has got.
 *
 * PIXI'S, which is why it is here and not on `main`. It reads a pixi manifest
 * through pixi's own `Assets`, so it means nothing to a twgl or three.js host;
 * `main` therefore carries neither this nor the pipeline that writes the
 * manifest. See D11.
 *
 * MOVED from reveal-or-die (`web/src/lib/world/render/assets.ts`), where it was
 * written as "this game's problem, not the framework's". That was right while
 * the framework had no art pipeline at all. Now that the pipeline is a node in
 * the tree, the loader belongs beside it: every pixi game on this branch loads
 * one bundle, publishes one progress value and has to survive the bundle
 * failing, and that is not something each of them should discover separately.
 * What stays the GAME's is which sprites exist and what they mean.
 *
 * Loading starts at module scope rather than in `onAppStarted`, so it overlaps
 * with everything else the app is doing instead of waiting for a canvas to
 * mount.
