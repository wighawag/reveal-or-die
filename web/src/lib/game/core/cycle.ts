/**
 * Cycles: the commit-reveal clock.
 *
 * This is framework, not a seam. Four independently written games (this one,
 * conquest, reveal-or-die, bomber-world and stratagems) compute the cycle the
 * same way, character for character:
 *
 *     cycleNumber = floor(timePassed / cycleDuration) + 2
 *     committing =
 *         timePassed - (cycleNumber - 2) * cycleDuration < commitPhaseDuration
 *
 * THE INDEX IS `cycleNumber` AND THE INTERVAL IS THE `cycle`, and this formula
 * is why the distinction is worth a word: it puts an index and two durations in
 * one expression, and calling the index by the interval's name is what used to
 * make it readable as a timestamp. See ADR-0001 (template-commit-reveal
 * `work`).
 *
 * The `+ 2` is not arbitrary: the contract starts at cycle 2 so that the
 * hypothetical reveal phase before the first commit phase can be cycle 1.
 *
 * THREE POLICIES, AND ONLY THE FIRST IS PURE ARITHMETIC:
 *
 * - `timed` follows the chain clock and nothing else, which is what a deployed
 *   game does. The formula above IS the answer.
 * - `manual` has no clock at all: the cycle moves when the players have all
 *   acted and someone pushes it, so the only way to know where it is is to ask.
 * - `hybrid` (timed with early advance) has the clock as a DEADLINE, with
 *   unanimity able to bring the next phase forward. The formula is then a
 *   FLOOR rather than an answer, because an advance is a transaction and no
 *   amount of arithmetic predicts one.
 *
 * Which is why, under the last two, the cycle is READ FROM THE CHAIN and the
 * local clock is only a predictor. Getting that the wrong way round is the
 * expensive mistake: a client that trusted its own arithmetic would let a
 * player plan into a window that had already closed, and the loss lands on the
 * stake rather than on the screen.
