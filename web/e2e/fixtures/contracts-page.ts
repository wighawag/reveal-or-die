/**
 * The contracts page, as a place two kinds of suite have to drive.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM `stalling-wallet.ts`, and the separation is load-bearing rather
 * than tidiness. `test/e2e-account-claims.test.ts` reads "imports
 * fixtures/stalling-wallet" as "drives the stalling wallet, and therefore claims
 * one of its accounts", which is exactly the right heuristic: that pool exists
 * so two suites cannot race for one address's nonce. While these locators lived
 * in that file, any suite that wanted a form locator had to import it and was
 * counted as claiming stalling account 0 alongside the suite that really drives
 * it. The guard then fires, correctly, on a claim nobody made.
 *
 * So what is shared here is the PAGE: which contract, which write, which form,
 * which button. Who is asked to sign it is the caller's business.
 *
 * MOVED UP FROM reveal-or-die (2026-09-11), where it was written after this
 * page's sort-order assumption broke four inherited tests there. Decision 2's
 * test - *would another game on this foundation have to write this?* - was
 * answered "yes" by an existing second copy, and this is the move rather than a
 * re-implementation: the descendant's copy is deleted in the same change.

 * The write this fixture drives, named once.
 *
 * `revokeDelegate`, this app's own. The suites import it rather than restating
 * it, because a suite that asserts on a form has to be looking at the form that
 * was actually filled.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONE LINE THIS REPO CHANGES, and upstream's copy says so at this
 * line - it is the only game-specific thing in the file, the
 * `mode.ts`/`TARGET_STEP` shape applied to a fixture. Upstream sends
 * `addToReserve`; this app does not have it. Everything else here is about the
 * PAGE and arrives unchanged.

 * called `AvatarSale` moved the page off the Game and failed four tests in
 * `contracts.e2e.ts` that never name a contract at all. None of the failures
 * named the cause either - the page was showing a different contract's functions
