/**
 * The path where a player loses a stake, in a real browser.
 *
 * Every other e2e test funds the signer first (`fundAppSenders`), so the whole
 * top-up remedy - the classification at the boundary, the HUD's offer, the
 * automatic resume - was covered only by unit tests. This is the one suite that
 * actually runs a move out of gas.
 *
 * It is worth the minutes it costs because of what the failure costs. A move is
 * signed by a local signer the player was never told about, holding only what
 * someone put in it; it can run dry between one epoch and the next. If the
 * failure is reported as a generic error, or the remedy is offered for
 * something a top-up cannot fix, or the round does not pick itself back up when
 * the gas lands, the player finds out by losing their bond.
 *
 * Three claims, in the order they matter:
 *
 * 1. the move fails as an OUT-OF-GAS failure, named as such
 * 2. the remedy is offered, next to the failure, without being asked for
 * 3. gas arriving from ANYWHERE resumes the round, all the way to Revealed
