/**
 * A WHOLE ROUND AGAINST A CHAIN IN THIS TAB.
 *
 * This is the only test in the tree that exercises the offline world end to
 * end, and it is the only one that can: everything it covers happens in a
 * BROWSER and nowhere else - the chain boots in a worker, `@rocketh/web` runs
 * this game's own deploy scripts against it, a generated wallet is announced
 * over EIP-6963, the app signs in over that wallet to derive the key it plays
 * with, and the cycle is pushed on by a transaction because the deployment
 * declares the MANUAL policy. `check` and `test:unit` prove the text compiles
 * and the units hold; they have never been able to say anything about this.
 *
 * IT CLAIMS NO WALLET ACCOUNT FROM THE SHARED POOL, and that is a fact about
 * this suite rather than an oversight. It sends plenty of transactions - eight
 * per round now that there are three players - and every one of them is on a
 * chain that exists only inside this test's own page, from keys that world
 * holds, on a chain id minted for it. There is no shared nonce to race for,
 * because there is nothing shared.
 *
 * AND IT IS A FAR STRONGER GATE THAN IT WAS, for free, because the world enrols
 * THREE waited-for members and plays two of them. The reveal phase cannot open
 * until every one of them has committed and the next cycle cannot start until
 * every commitment has been opened, so the two assertions at the bottom - a
 * reveal happening at all, and cycle 3 arriving - now say that the other two
 * players ACTED. Before there was anybody else to wait for, they said only
 * that `advanceCycle` was called.
 *
 * `test/e2e-account-claims.test.ts` decides which files need one by SEARCHING
 * THE SOURCE for the fixtures that connect a shared wallet, so a comment naming
 * those fixtures is indistinguishable from using them - this paragraph tripped
 * it and the suite failed for the collision it was explaining it could not
 * have. Describe them, do not spell them.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT is timing. The measurements are in the
 * plan on the `work` branch; a test that pinned them would fail on a busy
 * machine and say nothing about the game. The timeouts below are unchanged from
 * when one player played alone, which is the honest thing to check after adding
 * two more: a three-player round is a small multiple of a one-player round and
 * not a different order of magnitude, so widening them would have hidden a slow
 * loop rather than accommodated an inherently slower game. They are unchanged
 * again now that a LOBBY chooses the table, for the same reason - what was
 * added in front of the boot is a press, and what was taken out of it was a
 * dialog.
 *
 * AND IT NO LONGER PRESSES THE AUTHORISE BUTTON, which is a deliberate loss of
 * coverage and is recorded here rather than left to be noticed. That press used
 * to be the only UNCONDITIONAL drive of the top-up modal in the whole suite -
 * choose a payer, confirm, watch the registration land - and the world now does
 * the registration itself, through the same two functions that modal calls
 * (`registrationRequest` and `submitRegistration`), because offline the
 * question has one answer. So the CONTRACT half of the delegation path is still
 * exercised in a browser on every run, and asserted below off the chain rather
 * than off a button disappearing; the modal's own half is left to its unit
 * tests and to the suites that still meet that button when the shared chain has
 * already staked their account.

		// The chain is minted for this page, so the board started EMPTY and an

		// turn is a deterministic function of the cycle, so a collision would be a
		// permanent failure rather than a flake.
		//
		// A FLOOR AND NOT AN EQUALITY, because on a deployment where a placement is
		// free this quantity is not what its name says. `_place` counts a claimant
		// when the player's stake on the cell was zero, so at a zero placement cost
		// it is still zero afterwards and every placement counts again - measured at
		// nine for three rounds on that branch against seven here. That is a defect
		// in the contract and not in this test; it is recorded on the `work` branch
