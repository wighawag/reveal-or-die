/**
 * The transaction inspector, driven the way a user reaches it.
 *
 * Its unit tests cover the registry's rules; this covers the wiring those rules
 * sit on: a real operation in account data, a real click, a real URL. The
 * symptom it exists to catch is precise, and would pass every unit test: the
 * URL gains `?operation=<id>` and no dialog appears. That was real, and its
 * cause was that SvelteKit's `pushState` deliberately leaves `page.url` on the
 * route the page is showing, so the app read a URL without the param it had
 * just written and closed the overlay it had just opened.

	// Sends transactions, so it takes its own burner account: files run in
	// parallel workers and two sending from the same account race for a nonce.
	//
	// Index 3 rather than 2, because `out-of-gas.e2e.ts` needs 2 for a stronger
	// reason: it deliberately fails a commit, and the game keys one open
	// commitment per player per epoch, so it must not share a player with any
	// suite that commits. This one only needs an account nobody else sends from.
	test.use({walletAccountIndex: 3});

	// And serially WITHIN the file, for the same reason: `fullyParallel` applies
	// to tests, not just files, so these four would otherwise race each other
	// from that one account. Same rule, same cause, as the demo suite.
	describe.configure({mode: 'serial'});

	// It arrived from the template driving a greeting this app does not have, so
	// it had never run. Four things were wrong underneath that; three were test
	// bugs and are fixed, and they were worth finding on their own:
	//
	//  - it filled ONE argument of `addToReserve(address, uint256)`, so viem threw
	//    InvalidAddressError and nothing was sent. The same mistake made
	//    contracts.e2e.ts's write test vacuous for as long as it existed; that one
	//    now asserts an operation and passes for real.
	//  - it waited on the navbar PENDING BADGE, which clears at Included+Success
	//    and ignores finality, so against an instant-mining node it is open for
	//    ~400ms. The OPERATION persists (measured: Included/Success, `final`
	//    undefined), so it now waits for account data to hold one.
	//  - it took the drawer with `page.getByRole('dialog')`, which matches every
	//    dialog in every layer, so the visibility check was a strict-mode
	//    violation rather than a wait. Scoped to `#--layer-drawer`, as
	//    overlays.e2e.ts always has been.
	//
	// THE FOURTH WAS THE APP, and it is fixed. Reaching /transactions/ after a
	// write whose ARGS CONTAIN A NUMBER threw, uncaught:
	//
	//     TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt
	//
	// The URL changes, and then nothing renders and the drawer never closes.
	// Measured, with and without the preceding write:
	//
	//     no write:   +500ms url=/transactions/ heading=1   (fine)
	//     after write:+3000ms url=/transactions/ heading=0  + the TypeError
	//
	// So the link works - it was driven by hand too, and it navigates. What breaks
	// is rendering that page while an operation carries a bigint, which the
	// template's own demo never does because `setMessage(string)` has no numeric
	// argument. AccountData's storage serializer handles bigints correctly, so it
	// was not persistence; `core/utils/format/json.ts` had exported
	// `bigIntReplacer` and `toPlainJson` for exactly this the whole time and was
	// imported by nothing.
	//
	// OperationCard now stringifies with `bigIntReplacer`, and this suite is what
	// proves it: without that fix these three fail on a page that never renders.

	/**
	 * Leave an operation in account data and land on the transactions page.
	 *
	 * Two things here are deliberate, and both were learned by watching this fail.
	 *
	 * The WAIT: account data records an operation only once the transaction is
	 * broadcast, so leaving straight after the click abandons the send and the
	 * page has nothing to list. The navbar's pending badge is the app's own signal
	 * that an operation now exists.
	 *
	 * The CLIENT-SIDE navigation: `page.goto` is a full load, and account data is
	 * persisted asynchronously, so a reload immediately after the badge appears
	 * can discard an operation that was only ever in memory. Going through the
	 * menu is both what a user does and what keeps the app alive.
	 *
	 * WHAT IS SENT: a contracts-page write, not a game move. The inspector needs
	 * ONE operation in account data and does not care where it came from, and the
	 * game's commit is the wrong instrument for that - it depends on the epoch
	 * phase, keys one open commitment per player, and auto-commits as the phase
	 * closes, so a suite that only wants "a transaction happened" would be racing
	 * the round for no reason. `WRITE_FUNCTION` is a plain account-sent write that
	 * exists on the deployed Game and needs no set-up, which is why the
	 * stalling-wallet fixture and contracts.e2e.ts drive the same one.
	 *
	 * NAMED FROM THE FIXTURE, not spelled out. It has been wrong twice already:
	 * the template's `setMessage`, which this app does not deploy, and then the
	 * parent's `addToReserve`, which is on the parent's Game and not on this one.
	 * Both times every suite that open-coded the literal failed at the walk.
	 *
	 * It also sends from the ACCOUNT rather than the local signer, so no
	 * authorisation flow stands in front of it. This used to submit the template's
	 * greeting, which this app does not have, and so failed at the first line.
