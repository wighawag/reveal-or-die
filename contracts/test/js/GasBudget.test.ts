/**
 * THE DECLARED GAS BUDGET IS A CLAIM ABOUT THESE CONTRACTS, so these contracts
 * are what checks it.
 *
 * `commitGas` and `revealGas` are declared by the deploy
 * (`rocketh/config.ts`), recorded in the Game's `linkedData`, and read by the
 * client to size the gas stipend a new player is given. They used to be
 * constants in `web/src/lib/placement/config.ts`, which is INHERITED down this
 * template tree while contracts are NOT - so a descendant budgeted with figures
 * measured against a game it does not run, in a file whose text did not differ.
 *
 * Moving them to the deployment fixes whose numbers they are. This test is what
 * stops them rotting: a contract change that makes a commit or a reveal more
 * expensive than the deployment claims fails HERE, in the suite that ships with
 * the contracts, rather than in a player's wallet a release later.
 *
 * IT ASSERTS THE WORST CASE, NOT A TYPICAL ONE. For the reveal that is a FULL
 * chunk of cells claimed for the first time, each in a different zone, because
 * `_place` appends to a per-zone index only on a cell's first claim: four first
 * claims across four zones is four new dynamic arrays and there is no more
 * expensive shape a single reveal can take. For the commit it is the FIRST one
 * a player makes, when every slot it writes is cold.
 *
 * IT IS TWO-SIDED, BECAUSE THE FIGURES ARE NOW CEILINGS. The client passes them
 * as the gas LIMIT on every commit and every reveal, so a transaction that needs
 * more than the deployment declares does not cost more - it runs out of gas, and
 * on a reveal that is a missed reveal, which forfeits the stake. So the budget
 * must cover the worst case AND keep room above it; and it must not have drifted
 * so far above that nobody has re-measured in a long time.

 * contracts can reach today - a full chunk of cells claimed for the first time,
 * each in a different zone - so the headroom is not covering a shape the test
 * missed. It covers the two things the test cannot see: a chain that prices
 * some opcode differently from the one this runs on, and the contracts growing
 * a little between one re-measurement and the next.
 *
 * GAS USAGE IS OTHERWISE A PROPERTY OF THE CODE AND THE EVM REVISION RATHER
 * THAN OF THE CHAIN, which is why this is a margin and not a per-chain
 * measurement: `hardhat.config.ts` pins `evmVersion` on every profile, so the
 * same contracts cost the same gas wherever they run. What genuinely varies per
 * chain is the PRICE, and that is `expectedWorstGasPrice` in the chain
 * properties, which is already declared per chain and is what turns these
 * figures into money.
 *
 * It is deliberately looser than the margin the figures actually carry (12% to
 * 28%). A tripwire set exactly at the current value fires on the first trivial
 * change and gets raised reflexively, which is how a limit stops meaning
 * anything.
