 * commitment stays open until a chunk arrives declaring no further actions.

 * binds where identity is scarce, and is nobody's business here.
 *

 * test below because each fails silently and expensively:
 *
 * - a non-final chunk must be EXACTLY full, or a turn spreads over unbounded
 *   reveals;
 * - the cycle's tally counts TURNS and not transactions, or somebody else's
 *   advance strands the rest of a half-revealed turn;
