/**
 * How the cycle advances. Mirrors `UsingGameTypes.CyclePolicy`, whose ORDER is
 * the contract's: these are the enum's numeric values and rearranging them here
 * would silently deploy a different policy from the one named.
 *
 * `Timed` is what a deployed game wants, and it is the only one that needs no
 * transaction to move: the cycle simply is what the clock says.
 *
 * `Manual` has no clock at all. Every phase moves because someone pushed it,
 * and only once every member the cycle waits for has acted - so a member who
 * goes silent freezes it, and the way out is to stop waiting for them rather
 * than to add a timer.
 *
 * `TimedWithEarlyAdvance` is the clock as a DEADLINE, with unanimity able to
 * bring the next phase forward. Never worse than `Timed` for anyone absent,
 * because an advance only ever widens a window.
 *
 * Changing this changes the game the client draws, because it is recorded in
 * the Game's `linkedData` and read back. The e2e suite plays a TIMED game and
 * its waits are sized against the durations below.

				// Gas ONE USER ACTION costs, which since the reveal became chunked is
				// a commit plus ONE REVEAL STEP rather than a commit plus a whole
				// turn. A turn is no longer a transaction: it arrives in
				// `ceil(actions / actionsPerReveal)` reveals, so a long turn honestly
				// costs more credits than a short one, and a credit that still meant
				// "one turn" would be a number with no fixed gas behind it.
				//
				// MEASURED, on a local node, not reasoned about. At four actions per
				// reveal the worst case a single transaction can reach is a FULL
				// chunk of cells claimed for the first time, each in a different
				// zone: `_place` appends to a per-zone index only on a cell's first
				// claim, so four first claims across four zones is four new dynamic
				// arrays.
				//
				//   first commit (cold slots)                116,898
				//   later commit (warm slots)                 82,698
				//   full fresh chunk, four zones, final      535,561
				//   the same chunk, non-final                534,756
				//
				// So one commit plus one reveal step is 652,459 worst case, and this
				// is that plus about 15%, kept a round number because it is a policy
				// figure with a margin rather than a reading. The margin is what
				// keeps the credit count a FLOOR when a contract edit moves the gas a
				// little; if one moves it a lot, this is measured again rather than
				// nudged.
				//
				// IT WAS 1,500,000, sized against the old single-transaction reveal
				// whose worst case was ten placements at once (1,334,323). That
				// reveal no longer exists: ten placements is now three transactions,
				// each bounded by the chunk, and pricing a credit at the old figure
				// would overstate what one costs by more than half.
				//
				// It is the same number as `COMMIT_GAS + REVEAL_GAS` in
				// web/src/lib/placement/config.ts, and that agreement is now the
				// point rather than a coincidence: both are the worst case of one
				// commit plus one reveal step, which is what the chunk makes
				// calculable. They are still two numbers because they answer two
				// questions - this one prices what a step is CHARGED, that one sizes
				// a reservation - and a future edit may separate them again.

		/**
		 * Phase durations, and how much of a turn one transaction may carry.
		 *
		 * `actionsPerReveal` IS THE CHUNK, and it is here rather than in the
		 * contract because the two things that decide it are a property of the GAME
		 * (how expensive one action is to resolve) and of the CHAIN (what fits in a
		 * transaction there). A turn longer than this arrives in several reveals;
		 * the turn itself is not capped, and capping it is a game rule this
		 * framework deliberately does not take a position on.
		 *
		 * Four, for the reference game, and the number is chosen to be EXERCISED
		 * rather than to be the largest that fits. A placement's measured worst case
		 * is about 122k gas (ten fresh cells across ten zones cost 1,217,425), so a
		 * chunk of four is roughly half a million gas and would sit comfortably
		 * under any chain's ceiling at several times that size. What a larger number
		 * would cost is the only thing that matters here: this game's biggest
		 * possible turn is ten placements, so a chunk of sixteen or thirty-two would
		 * mean no turn anybody can make ever chains, and a mechanism that is never
		 * executed in the game the template ships is a mechanism nobody finds out is
		 * broken. A game built from this template picks its own, from its own
		 * measurements on its own chain.
		 *
		 * The reveal phase is the one to be careful with, and it used to be 3-4
		 * seconds. That is not survivable: a client has to NOTICE the phase turned
		 * over (the chain-synced clock ticks once a second), estimate gas, sign,
		 * broadcast, and then be MINED, all inside the window - and the contract
		 * judges the attempt by the timestamp of the block it lands in, not by when
		 * it was sent. Measured against a local node, a reveal fired the instant the
		 * phase opened still landed about 5 seconds later and reverted with
		 * `InCommitmentPhase`, forfeiting the bond.
		 *
		 * A missed reveal costs the player their stake, so this cannot be tuned
		 * optimistically. Size the reveal phase to comfortably exceed one block time
		 * plus a client round trip; ten seconds is generous on a local chain and is
		 * the floor to think from on a real one.
		 *
		 * AND IT IS NOW SIZED FOR SEVERAL TRANSACTIONS, NOT ONE. A turn longer
		 * than `actionsPerReveal` is revealed in `ceil(actions / actionsPerReveal)`
		 * transactions, in order, all of which have to land inside this window;
		 * anything still owed when it shuts is a partially applied turn whose
		 * remaining bond is forfeit. The reference game's largest possible turn is
		 * ten placements (the sale's `amount` over `placementCost`), so at four per
		 * reveal that is three sequential sends. Multiply the round trip above by
		 * that number before shortening this.
		 *
		 * THAT FACTOR IS THE CLIENT'S AND NOT THE CHAIN'S, which is the thing to
		 * know before treating it as a floor. Nonces are per account and strictly
		 * sequential, so the chunks could be broadcast in ONE burst and would still
		 * execute in order - one round trip rather than three. The client sends them
		 * one at a time today for reasons written at its reveal loop
		 * (`placement/commit-reveal.ts`), none of which is that a burst would not
		 * work. So a phase that is too short for a long turn is a pair of things to
		 * weigh rather than one: lengthen the window, or stop waiting between
		 * chunks.
