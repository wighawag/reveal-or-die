/**
 * EVERY IMPORT IN THIS REPO NAMES A FILE THAT EXISTS.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS A MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN A PRECAUTION. Two
 * consecutive cascades into this repo were broken by a hunk that merged
 * CLEANLY, which is the one thing a merge review does not look at:
 *
 *  - 2026-09-09: the template DELETED `game/render/pixi/PixiCanvas.svelte`, the
 *    deletion applied without complaint, and this repo's own
 *    `world/render/index.ts` went on importing it. Three conflicts were
 *    reported and correctly resolved; the build was broken by the part that had
 *    no conflict.
 *  - 2026-09-23: five files arrived as clean ADDS carrying nine imports of
 *    `$lib/placement`, a directory this repo deleted wholesale years of commits
 *    ago.
 *
 * Both are the same defect in two directions - a deletion that strands an
 * import, and an import that arrives naming something already deleted - and
 * neither of them is visible in `git status` after a merge, because git has
 * nothing to say about either.
 *
 * WHAT IT ADDS OVER `check` AND `test:unit`, which is a fair question because
 * both of those would have caught all seven files. It is not coverage, it is
 * WHEN AND HOW CHEAPLY. `offshoot-fanout --verify` runs the full verify and
 * catches this one step AFTER the mistake; the HAND path (the fanout stops at
 * the conflicts, a human resolves four routine-looking ones and moves on)
 * skips verify entirely, and with only four conflicts the temptation to skip it
 * is higher than it was at forty. This is a walk of the tree with no install,
 * no `svelte-kit sync` and no compile, so it can be run in the middle of a
 * conflicted merge, in about a second, before anything expensive:
 *
 *     node scripts/check-dangling-imports.mjs
 *
 * It is ALSO wired into `test:unit` (`web/test/dangling-imports.test.ts`), so
 * the tool path gets it too and there is one implementation rather than two.
 *
 * WHERE IT REALLY BELONGS is `offshoot-fanout`, as a post-merge step: this
 * failure is not specific to this repo or to renderers, and every level
 * boundary that moves a file between branches has it. That is what
 * `work/notes/findings/main-cannot-be-cascaded-into-reveal-or-die-until-the-repoint.md`
 * proposes. It is repo-local here because `offshoot-fanout` on this host is a
 * nix-store binary (0.6.0) with no source checkout to edit, so the generic
 * version is a different change in a different repo - and this repo is the one
 * that has now paid for the lesson twice.
 *
 * IT READS IMPORTS WITH THE TYPESCRIPT PARSER, NOT WITH A REGEX, and that was
 * not the first draft. A regex over `from '...'` reports every string that
 * merely LOOKS like an import, and this repo is full of them on purpose: the
 * boundary tests under `web/test` carry import statements as DATA, because
 * asserting about who may import `$app/*` means writing `$app/*` down. The
 * first draft reported nine dangling imports of which seven were those strings
 * and a sentence in a comment. A checker whose output is mostly noise is a
 * checker that gets skipped, which is precisely the failure it exists to stop.
 * `ts.preProcessFile` is the compiler's own scanner for exactly this question -
 * static imports, `export ... from`, dynamic `import()`, `require()` - and it
 * knows a string literal from a module specifier.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO is resolve bare specifiers. `viem`,
 * `svelte/store` and friends are package resolution, which is `pnpm install`'s
 * job and is already checked by everything downstream; asking about them here
 * would mean reproducing node's resolution algorithm in order to re-answer a
 * question nothing gets wrong. What a cascade breaks is PATHS INSIDE THE REPO,
 * and those are exactly what this resolves.
